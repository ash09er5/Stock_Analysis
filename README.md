# Stock_analysis

# Overview!
The objective of this challenge is to refractor code that was done earlier in the moduel and make it more effiecnt 
than the original.Also to identify the best perfoming stocks in the market

# Results
Runtimes were all very quick as the orignal and refractored versions dont have much of a difference in time. would i use it 
as a reson to refrator it? not really as the time these scripts run you would not notice the difference

Orignal 2018

# Problems

when i would run the analysis the program out always output the results on the 2017 worksheet. I was not able to correct this problem but to get the results i would have to 
clear the page and copy and paste the 2017 data back into the sheet
